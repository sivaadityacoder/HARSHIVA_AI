# Authorization and Legal Guidelines

## Overview

The XBOW Autonomous Web Bug Hunter is a powerful security assessment tool designed for authorized penetration testing and bug bounty programs. **Proper authorization is required before conducting any security testing.**

## Legal Requirements

### 1. Written Authorization
- **ALWAYS** obtain explicit written permission before testing any target
- Authorization must be from someone with legal authority over the target systems
- Keep documentation of authorization throughout the engagement
- Include scope limitations and any restrictions in writing

### 2. Applicable Laws
You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws including:
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States
- Computer Misuse Act in the United Kingdom  
- Local and international cybersecurity laws
- Terms of service and acceptable use policies

### 3. Scope Limitations
- Only test systems explicitly included in your authorization
- Respect any timing restrictions or business hour limitations
- Avoid testing production systems unless specifically authorized
- Do not access, modify, or delete any data without permission

## Ethical Guidelines

### 1. Responsible Disclosure
- Report vulnerabilities promptly to the appropriate parties
- Allow reasonable time for remediation before public disclosure
- Follow coordinated disclosure timelines when applicable
- Respect any non-disclosure agreements

### 2. Minimal Impact Testing
- Use passive reconnaissance techniques by default (`--passive-only`)
- Minimize network traffic and system load
- Avoid denial-of-service conditions
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept

### 3. Professional Conduct
- Maintain confidentiality of discovered information
- Only use findings for authorized security purposes
